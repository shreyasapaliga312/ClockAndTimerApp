echo "# Clock And Timer App" >> README.md

Project Overview

The Clock and Timer App is designed to provide accurate time tracking and flexible timing tools for both daily use and sports applications. Unlike standard clock apps, this project combines general-purpose timing features with game timers for Chess and Kabaddi, all within one application.

The app follows a modular design, ensuring clarity, simplicity, and ease of navigation.
